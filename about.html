                The Karen (pronounced Ka-REN) are an ethnic group from the mountainous border regions of Burma and Thailand, where they are the second largest ethnic group in each country. They have long been subject to persecution and ethnic cleansing by the Burmese government. Many have been living in refugee camps in Thailand for years before being resettled to Nebraska. Approximately 7,500 Karen live in Nebraska, with an additional 500 refugees from other ethnic groups in Burma. Because of the employment opportunity and family reunion, Omaha currently has the most significant and fastest-growing Karen populations in the U.S. Other communities in Nebraska with a large Karen population include Lincoln, Crete, Nebraska City, Grand Island, Norfolk, and Dakota City.
