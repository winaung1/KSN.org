        <p class="pb-5">
            A place that brings our community together and serves as a meeting point is our community offices. 
            They are the hub where we support each other and lead our community forward toward achieving ultimate self-sufficiency. 
            Many refugees visit the offices for help reading and understanding the wide variety of letters they receive in the mail, 
            filling out application forms, setting up appointments, finding employment, receiving immigration services and using the computer lab. 
            We serve all refugees and immigrants from Burma (Myanmar) who now call Nebraska their home.
            The KSN is a bridge between the refugee community, resources,  community organizations and agencies. We are supported by churches, schools and individuals. 
            Due to widespread community support and volunteerism, The KSN has two community offices to serve refugees from Burma as a result.

            A brief history of the Karen Office, Lincoln: Karen people who have more English have been helping others in the community to read their mail. 
            In March of 2009, Martha Sorenson from First Baptist Church was asked to start working in an apartment, reading mail and setting up appointments. 
            In 2013, the landlord, Jon Carlson, donated one apartment for a Karen office. 
            The Center for People in Need, is paying the utilities, telephone and supporting everything that the office requires, including a number of computers for classes. 
            Two of their AmeriCorps volunteers have taken charge of the office and are setting up classes.
