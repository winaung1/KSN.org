            The goal of the KSN Youth Committee is to create a space where Karen, Zomi and Karenni youth in our community can grow, be creative and unique, 
            and feel empowered to reach their dreams and achieve life success.

                    The Youth Committee is comprised of youth of all ages, including elementary, 
                    middle and high school, college and university students, as well as adults interested in working with youth. We join together to foster leadership, education, and success. 
                    Our youth are encouraged to lead by example and develop positive values, such as helping their families and volunteering in the community. 
                </p>
                <p class="pb-5">
                    Our committee works to keep youth away from high risk behaviors, such as drinking, drugs and smoking and instead encourages them to maintain healthy lifestyles. 
                    We host events, workshops and activities for youth where they have the opportunity to learn about each other and grow together through education and service. Friendships, 
                    networking and connections serve as a bridge for youth to make smooth transitions from one education area to another.

                    As immigrants and refugees from an under-developed part of the world, it is not easy to learn the customs of life in a new country without community collaboration. 
                    The foundation of our team is to strengthen our youth so they continue to be successful in education and life. We give special thanks to our local community for supporting us. We welcome anyone interested in youth development to join us. 
                    Your participation matters and makes a difference in helping us grow in our communityf you want to partner with our team please don't hesitate to contact us at info@karenksn.org.
