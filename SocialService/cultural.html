            KSN Cultural Committee is dedicated to preserve the culture and heritage of refugees from Burma for their benefit and the benefit of the larger community. 
            We maintain our cultural identity and educate the community in a variety of ways, including participation in local festivals, events and activities.
             We would like to say thank you to organizations, churches and individuals who have supported the integration of refugees from Burma into Nebraskan society. 
             The KSN enjoys sharing the culture of refugees from Burma, while also learning from American culture as well. We are happy to perform or present information at your event. 
            If you are interested in learning more about refugees from Burma, please contact us.
