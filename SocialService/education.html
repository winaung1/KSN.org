                    This is a group of people who work relative to or in the interest of education. We believe education is the key to future success for individuals and the greater community. 
                    As a society of refugees, we work closely with local schools, teachers, and other agencies to meet the educational needs of learners and support refugees from Burma in reaching their highest potential and meeting their educational goals. 
                    
                </p>
                <p  class="pb-5">
                    Through partnering with organizations, we provide opportunities to increase the education of students and adult learners. We connect refugees with speakers and organizations who provide training in a variety of educational areas.
                    We recognize the importance of parent and family engagement in student education. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We partner with the public school districts and other agencies to teach parents how to engage in their student's education and be partners in their learning. Many parents come to the United States with little or no educational background, and therefore do not know how to advise their children. We want refugee parents to have the support and knowledge needed to encourage their children. With the guidance and support of school districts, community centers and literacy organizations, we provide educational workshops regarding the overall education system, as well as targeted areas that parents have expressed concern and interest in. 
                    'We have a strong partnership with the public schools and are grateful for their ability to go above and beyond in connecting us with educational resources.
