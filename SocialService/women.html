                    The KSN Women's Committee works to help women in our community move toward self-sufficiency. 
                    Because of the social, cultural, and lifestyle differences between the refugee camp and US society, women have difficulty becoming well-integrated into American society. 
                </p>
                <p  class="pb-5">
                    Due to lack of education and resources in the refugee camps, as well as new language barriers create challenges that prevent women from receiving the support and gaining information. 
                    Our Women's Committee provides an environment where women can support one another, increase their education, and develop leadership skills needed to reach their potential and attain self-sufficiency. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Committee is a source of support for family problems, concerns with children and teens, marriage, death, abuse, women's health, pregnancy and many other issues of concern. 
                    We facilitate educational information, workshops, speakers and what resources are available for women refugees. We welcome an individual or agency to partner with us to make our journey smoother to having a better life in Nebraska society. 
                    If you want to partner with our team please don't hesitate to contact us at info@karenksn.org.
