                Asking questions and providing information to your doctor and other care providers can improve your care. 
                Talking with your doctor builds trust and leads to better results, quality, safety, and satisfaction. 
                One of the best ways to communicate with your doctor and health care team is by asking questions. 
                Because time is limited during medical appointments, you will feel less rushed if you prepare your questions before your appointment. 
                That is why they need you to speak up. 
                Questions to ask before your appointment. 
                Questions to ask during your appointment. Questions to ask after your appointment. Build your own list of questions
